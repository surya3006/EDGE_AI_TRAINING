AI Model Training â€“ Project Motive
ðŸŽ¯ Project Motive

The purpose of this project is to learn, implement, and understand core machine learning concepts by building different models from scratch and training them on real datasets.

Machine learning can feel like a black box when using high-level libraries.
This project aims to break that black box by:

Explaining the math behind popular algorithms (linear regression, logistic regression, etc.)

Implementing them step by step so that anyone can follow along

Visualizing results to connect theory with intuition

Training on real-world datasets (like MNIST) to show practical use cases

The motive is educational:

"If I can build it from scratch and explain it, I truly understand it."

This repository can serve as:

A learning resource for beginners exploring ML

A reference implementation for students or hobbyists

A starting point for experimenting with model modifications and improvements

ðŸ’¡ Why This Project?

Bridge the gap between theory and practice â€“ Most tutorials only show final formulas, here we code the steps

Hands-on approach â€“ Learning by doing, not just reading

Foundation for future projects â€“ These are the building blocks for deep learning

ðŸ“Œ Goals

Build a solid understanding of:

Regression (linear, polynomial)

Classification (logistic regression)

Neural networks (MNIST training)

Learn how to:

Preprocess data

Train models

Visualize predictions and errors

Evaluate performance
